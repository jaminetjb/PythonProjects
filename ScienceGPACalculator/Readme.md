ScienceGPACalculator

A Python script that takes in a text file of three lines; 
name and description of the course, 
the credits of the course, 
and the quality points earned in the course.

This program parses through the text file and calculates the GPA.

Note: The file must have that format and can be used to calculate any GPA in the format. 
It just has the name scienceGPAcalc because I had to calculate my science GPA for grad school and wanted to do it more efficientiy.
